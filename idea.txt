Adamya's Ideas: 
1. Productivity Management System
    Contains a authentication system, Note Taking Application, Timer for study/work time tracking,
    A todo list interface, a monthly goals interface and a daily challenges field. 

    Authentication System:
        Users have to be authenticated and they should be linked such that a user can see their and only their
        information(notes, challenges, monthly goals, so on). The password should be hashed so that even if the 
        database is compromised, user's personal information won't be out in the open. 

    Note Taking Application: 
        Self explanatory for the most part. The user should be able to take notes within the applciation
        and be able to save the notes to DATABASE as well as their PERSONAL COMPUTER. This is to ensure
        multi level backup.

    Timer: 
        Self explanatory. Keep a timer that takes an integer input from the user and runs for the same
        number of minutes.

    To-Do list: 
        Challenges to be set everyday by the users. These reset at the end of the day.

    Daily Challenges; 
        These don't reset at all. They appear on the todo list everyday automatically. 

    Monthly Challenges
        Same as todo list but these are more long term goals. They reset after 30 days of adding. 

    Difference between todo list and daily challenges: 
        The daily challenges are recurring but the todo list isn't. Meaning, 
        the user will have to add new todo list content everyday but not daily challenges.
        They are added automatically everyday.
